//Create a page that displays a list of People (or whatever interests you).
//On top of the page, have a link that says "Add Person". When this link
//is clicked, the user should be taken to a page that has a form that 
//has textboxes for firstname/lastname/age (or whatever thing you're doing).
//Beneath that, there should be a submit button. When the button is clicked,
//the person should get added to the database, and the user should be redirected
//back to the list of all the people.

//Second exercise:

//Add a column to your table called "Delete". In each row of the table, there
//should be a delete button, that when clicked, will delete that person from the
//database, and redirect the user back to the page that shows a list of all people.
//The way to achieve this is to embed each Delete button in a form that posts
//to an Action on your controller that will delete that person. Inside that form,
//also have a hidden input with the id of that person. Then, in your controller,
//take that id in as a parameter, delete that person, and then redirect back to
//the list page.

//<input type="hidden" name="id" value="some id" />
